You need to solvee at least 150 Leet code questions within 2 months, apply in at least 10 big tech companies, increase your online presence especially on github.com code contributions, and you need to hav some onlin creations which you can showcase in your resume. All this is a pre-requisite to get your resume selected. After that, you need to be able to clear 4-6 rounds of interviews, that too if you are selected in a pre-onsite TPI interview. Its tough, i've got to tell you. Are you upto it? Honestly, I am not sure. You have to let me know how prepared you are and how committed you can be before I spill any more beans."
